OpenGL User Interface Code: Options

PUI

Looks like the old SGI buttons.  Pretty attractive.  Kindof a huge download/install, since it's integrated with "PLIB".

Everything inherits from puObject.

Actually ugly as crap--it's got that hideous X11/SGI/xfig/xv feeling to it where it's hardcore command-line people saying "I can do something like a gui.  More or less."  Also not very small at all--500K download; statically linked binary is 800K using a bunch of widgets.  I hate autoconf.
