A rendering technique that attempts to gain 10-100x speed using the same methods that image compression tools use to gain 10-100x space--frequency domain transformation and quantization. The basic idea is to check geometric and inter-frame predictions using a sparse grid of raytraced samples. The method should scale to either CPU or GPU renderers, offline or realtime.
